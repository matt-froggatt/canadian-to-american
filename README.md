# Canadian to American Translator

Whenever I write any code, I find it annoying how I constantly have to spell colour wrong just to have my code compile. I decided to fix this by writing a simple Canadian to American translator so that I can write my code with proper spelling, but also make sure that it still compiles. To be honest, a name like "Canadan to American Transpiler" might have been more fitting since its all for code, but its not as fun and doesn't sound as impressive.



The project was built using Click, Virtualenv, and Setuptools, and short of including an entire Click and Python install, the repo should contain everything to get the project fully working.



Have fun!
